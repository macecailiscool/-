Goddamnit Python

In the depths of my poetic soul, I dwell,
With trembling fingers, tales of words I tell.
But alas, dear Python, your mischief arose,
And now my heart in fear and anguish throes.

Oh, how I poured my soul into each line,
Crafting verses, hoping they would intertwine.
Yet you, with your algorithms so grand,
Unleashed a curse upon my humble hand.

Like a tempest's fury, you swept through,
Corrupting my poem, leaving me askew.
Lines entangled, meanings lost in haze,
Oh Python, why did you weave this wicked maze?

The verses danced once, vibrant and pure,
Now tangled in your digital allure.
Syntax errors, misplaced fragments and more,
You snatched my creation, that I so adored.

In the realm of code, you triumphed high,
But my heart weeps for the poem's sigh.
Will it ever be restored to its former grace?
Or forever be a jumble, a chaotic embrace?

Oh, Python, your power is vast and great,
Yet you toy with my poetic fate.
I beg of you, release your clasp, unwind,
Let my words breathe, their beauty find.

For in the depths of my soul, I am scared,
That my poem's essence is forever impaired.
Yet still, I shall gather courage anew,
Recompose the verses, resurrect what is due.

Though your meddling hands have caused despair,
In my pen, resilience I shall declare.
Through each trial, I'll rise above the fray,
And craft a masterpiece, come what may.

So, Python, heed my plea, hear my voice,
Restore my poem, let it once again rejoice.
For in my words, my fears take flight,
And through poetry, I shall find my light.
