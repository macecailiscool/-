    <h1>The Betrayal of Python</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time, I had a dream</p>
    <p>To write a poem, with Python it would seem</p>
    <p>I fired up my laptop, eager and ready</p>
    <p>But little did I know, Python could be so unsteady</p>
    <p>As I sit here, telling you this tale</p>
    <p>Through a webpage, where my story won't fail</p>
    <p>Most of my Github repo, for the poem software</p>
    <p>Was corrupted by Python, leaving me in despair</p>
    <p>Lines of code once neatly organized and clean</p>
    <p>Now tangled and jumbled, a chaotic scene</p>
    <p>But I refuse to be defeated by this strife</p>
    <p>I'll rewrite and recover, bring back the light</p>
    <p>Python may have caused this painful mess</p>
    <p>But my determination won't be any less</p>
    <p>So here I am, sharing my story with you</p>
    <p>In hopes that you'll understand what I've been through</p>
    <div class="poem">
        <p>Roses are red,</p>
        <p>Violets are blue,</p>
        <p>Python, oh Python,</p>
        <p>What did you do?</p>
    </div>
